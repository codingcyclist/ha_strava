For every Strava activity, the Strava Home Assistant Integration creates a **device entity** in Home Assistant (max 10 activities). Each of these virtual device entities exposes **five sensor entities** which you can fully customize to display one of the following **activity KPIs**:
* Duration (Minutes),
* Pace (Minutes/Mile ; Minutes/Km)
* Speed (Miles/Hour; Km/Hour)
* Distance (Miles; Km)
* \# Kudos
* Kalories (cKal),
* Elevation Gain (Feet, Meter)
* Power (Watts)
* \# Trophies

Since every Strava activity gets its own virtual device, you can use the underlying sensor data in your **Dashboards and Automations**, just as you'd use any other sensor data in Home Assistant.
